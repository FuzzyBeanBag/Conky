# Conky
Random Conky Scripts I threw together

These are just Conky Config files using Conky v1.10 :

.conkyrc -      Your basic in the right top corner conky that you see everyone has with some graphs added to it

.conky-style -  A one line (( long ass line )) using ${goto ####} for placement of the sections across the top of the screen
                in a bar style placement. I have included screenshots of both files to show you what they look like.
                

To load conky from terminal:

$ conky --config=/path/to/your/config/.conkyrc-style 

or

$ conky --config=/path/to/your/config/.conkyrc
